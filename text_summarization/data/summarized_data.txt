In an attempt to build an AI-ready workforce, Microsoft announced Intelligent Cloud Hub
which has been launched to empower the next generation of students with AI-ready skills.
Envisioned as a three-year collaborative program, Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100
institutions with AI infrastructure, course content and curriculum, developer support,
development tools and give students access to cloud and AI services.
The company will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services such as
Microsoft Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning.
Earlier in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional
Program In AI as a learning track open to the public.
